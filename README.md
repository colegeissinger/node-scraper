# node-scraper
An example of a basic website scraper built using Node.js

This small example is to show what is needed to scrape a page. It's built to loop through an array of URLs and produce a single JSON file of the scraped data.

This would be a great starting ground to producing JSON that is ready for import to the WordPress JSON REST API, but it will need some work to produce that right output.
